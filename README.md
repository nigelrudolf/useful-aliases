# useful-aliases

Helps with launching simulators and working with worktrees. Use these commands in the root of your project.

## Setup
To use the aliases that help with worktrees, you will need to setup the following directory structure:

```
mkdir ~/Work

mkdir ~/Work/worktrees
```

## Installation

Copy the aliases you need directly into your `~/.zshrc`, close the terminal and start a new one. If `~/.zshrc` does not exist, create it.
